This is an application for exchanging messages between two operators using the IP Internet protocol. You can communicate both within the local network and on the Internet using a white IP address. When using a white IP address, you need to configure your router or Wi-Fi router so that traffic on port 1234 arrives at your computer on the local network (do port forwarding).
